# jwe-json-serialization-kotlin
JWE JSON Serialization (to allow for JWE with multiple recipients) using Nimbus building blocks.

(Nimbus does not yet support JWE JSON Serialization out of the box)

Another alternative actually supporting JWE with multiple recipients on the JVM seems to be org.apache.cxf:cxf-rt-rs-security-jose (ref: https://github.com/apache/cxf/blob/master/rt/rs/security/jose-parent/jose/src/test/java/org/apache/cxf/rs/security/jose/jwe/JweJsonProducerTest.java)
